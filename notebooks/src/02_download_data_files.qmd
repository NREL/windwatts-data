This notebook guides the user regarding how to download timeseries data as .csv files.

Note: The users AWS credentials should be exported in the created environment.

```{python}
# import package
from windwatts_data import WTKLedClient1224
```

We have imported WTKLedClient1224 class.

```{python}
# Initialize object to the WTKLedClient
# Since the config file is in same directory "notebooks" as the ".ipynb" file, the below config path works.
wtk_1224_client = WTKLedClient1224(config_path='./1224_config.json')
```

### Download csv.gz files
```{python}
# Downloading data of nearest location for 2 years with respect to lat and long.
wtk_1224_client.download_1224_data(lat=51.0,long=-162.0,years=[2001,2002])
```

This will download the csv.gz files in the downloads folder of current directory.

```{python}
## Downloading data of 4 nearest locations for a single year with respect to lat and long. Data is available for years 2001 to 2020.
wtk_1224_client.download_1224_data(lat=51.0,long=-162.0,n_nearest=4,years=[2008])
```

Please refer to package documentation for more details about this function.
