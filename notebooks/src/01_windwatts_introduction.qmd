This notebook gives a basic idea of how to setup and use the windwatts_data package.

Note: The users AWS credentials should be exported in the created environment.

### Import class from the package
```{python}
# Import class WTKLedClient1224 to work with WTK-Led 1224 Data
from windwatts_data import WTKLedClient1224
```

### Assign config file
```{python}
# give path to the create json config file as config_path
wtk_1224_client = WTKLedClient1224(config_path='./1224_config.json')
```


### Fetch column names
```{python}
# Getting Column names of WTK 1224 Data
cols = wtk_1224_client.get_column_names()
for col in cols:
    print(col)
```

It is suggested to go through the columns as it helps in understanding at what heights does the data have for columns like windspeed and winddirection.

### Retrieve grid locations
```{python}
# Print location gdf of the wtk data to investigate about available grid locations.
print(wtk_1224_client.get_location_gdf())
```
